The proposed model structure is shown in the figure.

### Software:

We have made an executable file to help researchers who do not have a background in deep learning to use our methods to extract glacier.

The software has the following features: 1.Supports Landsat 8/9 sensors. 2.Support for GPU acceleration. 3.Support batch processing of data. 4.Support the selection of different input features. 5.Support the extraction of clean glaciers and moraine-covered glacier
