DFFSwin: A complete deep learning framework in glacier boundary extraction for Landsat 8/9 sensors
====

The code will be made public after acceptance of the manuscript.

The proposed model structure is shown in the figure.

### Software:

We have made an executable file to help researchers who do not have a background in deep learning to use our methods to extract glacier.

The software has the following features: 1. Supports Landsat 8/9 sensors. 2. Support for GPU acceleration. 3. Support batch processing of data. 4. Support the selection of different input features. 5. Support the extraction of clean glaciers and debris-covered glacier.

The running process is shown in the figure

Currently the software language is Chinese, and will be changed to English.
